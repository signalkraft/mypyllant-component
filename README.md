Home Assistant component that interfaces with the myVAILLANT API (and branded versions of it, such as the MiGo Link app
from Saunier Duval & Bulex).

> [!WARNING]  
> If you're using sensoAPP or the multiMATIC app, this integration won't work for you. Try

## Features

![Default Dashboard Screenshot](docs/docs/assets/default-dashboard.png)

* Supports climate & hot water controls, as well as sensor information
* Control operating modes, target temperature, and presets such as holiday more or quick veto
* Set the schedule for climate zones, water heaters, and circulation pumps
  with [a custom service](https://signalkraft.com/mypyllant-component/2-services/#setting-a-time-program)
* Track sensor information of devices, such as temperature, humidity, operating mode, energy usage, or energy efficiency
* See diagnostic information, such as the current heating curve, flow temperature, firmware versions, or water pressure
* Custom services to set holiday mode or quick veto temperature overrides, and their duration

## Installation

### HACS

1. [Install HACS](https://hacs.xyz/docs/setup/download)
2. Search for the myVAILLANT integration in HACS and install it
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. [Add myVaillant integration](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=mypyllant)
5. Sign in with the email & password you used in the myVAILLANT app (or MiGo app for Saunier Duval)

### Manual

1. Download [the latest release](https://github.com/signalkraft/mypyllant-component/releases)
2. Extract the `custom_components` folder to your Home Assistant's config folder, the resulting folder structure should
   be `config/custom_components/mypyllant`
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. [Add myVaillant integration](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=mypyllant), or go to
   Settings > Integrations and add myVAILLANT
5. Sign in with the email & password you used in the myVAILLANT app (or MiGo app for Saunier Duval & Bulex)

## Options

### Seconds between scans

Wait interval between updating (most) sensors. **Don't set this too low, for example 10 leads to quota exceeded errors
and a temporary ban**.

The energy data and efficiency sensors have a fixed hourly interval.

### Delay before refreshing data after updates

How long to wait between making a request (i.e. setting target temperature) and refreshing data.
The Vaillant takes some time to return the updated values.

### Default duration in hours for quick veto

When setting the temperature with the climate controls, the integration uses the "quick veto" feature of the myVAILLANT
app.

With this option you can set for how long the temperature should stay set, before returning to the default value.

### Default duration in days for away mode

When the away mode preset is activated, this duration is used to for the end date (default is 365 days).

### Temperature controls overwrite time program instead of setting quick veto

When raising or lowering the desired temperature in the myVAILLANT app, it sets a quick veto mode for a limited time
with that new temperature, if the zone is in time controlled mode. If you want to permanently change the desired
temperature, you need to update the time schedule.

By default, this integration has the same behavior. But when enabling this option, the Home Assistant climate controls
instead overwrite the temperatures set in the time schedule with the new value (unless quick veto is already active).

### Country

The country you registered your myVAILLANT account in. The list of options is limited to known supported countries.

If a country is missing, please open an issue.

### Brand

Brand of your HVAC equipment and app, pick Saunier Duval if you use the MiGo Link app.

## Known Issues

### Lack of Test Data for Different Systems

Your HVAC system might differ from the ones in `Tested on` above.
If you don't see any entities, or get an error during setup, please check `Debugging` below and create an issue.
With debugging enabled, there's a chance to find the culprit in the data returned by the myVAILLANT API and fix it.

## Entities

You can expect these entities, although names will vary based on your home name (here "Home"),
installed devices (in this example "aroTHERM plus" and "hydraulic station"),
or the naming of your heating zones (in this case "Zone 1"):

### Debugging

When debugging or reporting issues, turn on debug logging by adding this to your `configuration.yaml`
and restarting Home Assistant:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.mypyllant: debug
    myPyllant: debug
```
